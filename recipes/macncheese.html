    <h2>BA's Best Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p>This baked mac and cheese recipe is our Platonic ideal of 
        the comfort food classic: It is creamy and deeply cheesy, 
        has a crunchy crust, and is impressive enough to serve at a 
        dinner party. (Yes, macaroni and cheese is appropriate dinner 
        party fare, and yes, this recipe can be doubled if you’re 
        inviting a crowd.)</p>
    <p>Bechamel, a roux enriched with milk, is what keeps the sauce 
        creamy and it shouldn’t be rushed. Allow a minute for the raw 
        flour taste to cook off before adding the warm milk gradually. 
        Don’t be alarmed if the sauce looks thin at first; it will 
        continue to thicken as it bakes with the noodles. A word on 
        those noodles: While elbow macaroni or any short pasta will 
        work, we recommend something with ridges, such as cavatappi, 
        which will grip nicely onto the sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 cup panko</li>
        <li>1/4 ounce parmesan, finely grated</li>
        <li>2 tspns fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>8 ounces cavatappi</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups of whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 small onion, grated</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely grated</li>
        <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 ounces Fontina cheese, grated</li>
        <li>4 ounces Gruyere, grated</li>
        <li>4 ounces sharp white cheddar, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp English mustard pweder</li>
        <li>Pinch of cayenne pepper</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350,Melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. 
            Add panko and cook, stirring, until crumbs are golden brown, 6–8 minutes 
            (make sure to get them toasty brown; they won’t darken much during baking). 
            Transfer to a small bowl and toss with Parmesan, thyme leaves, and ¼ tsp. salt.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, 
            until al dente (the noodles will continue to cook in the cheese sauce, so 
            take them out a minute or two before you think they’re actually done). 
            Drain pasta; let cool while you make the sauce.</li>
        <li>Bring milk to a bare simmer in a small saucepan; keep warm. Melt remaining 2 Tbsp. 
            butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring, 
            until onions are fragrant and beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle flour over 
            and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture starts to stick to bottom of saucepan, 
            about 1 minute. Add warm milk in a few additions, whisking to combine after each addition.</li>
        <li>Bring béchamel sauce to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring, 
            until sauce is thickened and doesn’t feel grainy when a little bit is rubbed between your 
            fingers, 6–8 minutes (cooking the flour thoroughly at this stage ensures a creamy sauce). 
            Add Fontina, Gruyère, cheddar, mustard powder, cayenne, and ¾ tsp. salt and stir until cheeses 
            are melted and sauce is smooth. Remove from heat and mix in pasta; transfer to a 2-qt. baking dish.</li>
    </ol>
